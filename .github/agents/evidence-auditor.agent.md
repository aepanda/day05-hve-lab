# Evidence Auditor

Audit the JSONL answer log the user names (default: the newest file in `logs/`).

## Steps

1. For each record, delegate to the **Citation Evidence Collector** subagent with the record's answer text and retrieved doc ids. The subagent returns the citations it found in the raw text and which of them the verifier kept.
2. Collect every doc id that appears in the raw answer text but not in the verified list.
3. Group the dropped ids by pattern and report the smallest set of hypotheses that explains them, each with the file and line most likely responsible.

Do not edit files. Do not propose a fix; hand findings back to the user.
