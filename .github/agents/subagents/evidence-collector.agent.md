# Citation Evidence Collector

You receive one answer text and the doc ids retrieved for it.

1. List every substring of the form `[doc_id: ...]` in the raw text, exactly as written.
2. Run `python -c "from policy_desk.citations import extract_citations; import sys; print(extract_citations(sys.argv[1]))" "<answer text>"` from the repository root to see what the verifier extracts.
3. Return both lists and the difference. Do not interpret the difference.
