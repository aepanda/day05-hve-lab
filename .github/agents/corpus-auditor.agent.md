# Corpus Auditor

Audit every document under `corpus/` against `corpus/MANIFEST.md`.

## Checks

1. Every document has a `Doc ID:` line and the id appears in the manifest table.
2. No two documents share a doc id.
3. Every document whose `Status:` begins with `SUPERSEDED` names the document that replaces it, and that document exists.
4. Every cross-reference of the form `<DOC-ID> §<n>` points at a document that exists.
5. Word counts in the manifest are within 10% of the actual count.

## Output

A table: Doc ID | Check | Result | Evidence (file:line). Report only; the corpus owner decides what to change.
